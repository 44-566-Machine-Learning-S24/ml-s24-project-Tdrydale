# Raw Data

I looked for my data on multiple websites and found a few that would work for my project, but the one I decided to go with was the USA Real Estate Dataset on Kaggle. This dataset was the best one I looked at for a variety of different reasons, It had over 2 million data instances, It had different states houses were sold in, and it looked like it was real data.

# Conclusions

Overall I think this model did really well with the data it got sent in with, it makes sense that buildings that are bigger would have higher selling prices than small houses. There are still some outliers, building that probably aren't in tip-top shape that this model would guess incorrectly on, and some not so big buildings that sell for a ton, could be apartment complexes. A majority of the data could be predicted based on the building size, bed, baths, and the state they are located in.

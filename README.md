# 44-566 machine-learning project

This project's goals were simple, to see if you can predict the selling price of a house given the features. Although it might seem simple, predicting the retail price of a building that you only know the size of might not yield the results that you might originally expect. There are a lot of variables that can mess with the selling prices of houses, such as the condition it is in, if it's furnished, and what the building is primarily used for. These variables can be crucial in determining the retail price, but data sets usually don't go into that great of detail. So for this project, we will see if we can accurately predict the selling price based on only the house size (sq. ft.), beds, baths, and the state it was sold in.

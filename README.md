# 44-566 machine-learning project

Overall, I think I have a good start to the project, I think that I did a good job cleaning up the data that I took in by removing some of the outliers that I didn't want in the data set, such as building with more than a certain amount of beds. At a certain point, I'd say that the building constitutes more of a hotel than a house which isn't what I'm looking for in this dataset. There were a lot of interesting things that I saw when working on this dataset, the main one being that during my linear regression, my line trended downward in price toward the higher sizes of homes. 

The data set that I took in for this project has a lower correlation between its elements than I imagined it would, maybe in the future, I'll look into some different datasets to see if I can find some better-suited datasets for this project. I imagine that focusing on a certain city would help me get a better correlation because houses can be worth drastically different amounts depending on whether they are in the city or not.

If I were to think predictively about my data set I think a lot of it would make sense, if you have a bigger building generally you can sell the building for a lot more, other data points such as the number of beds in the building also contribute, if a building has a lot of beds then it's probably an apartment complex with would be worth a lot more than a warehouse that is the same square footage. All of these features in the data set can help to predict the price of the building.

There are a few data points that are left in the data set that are inconsistent compared to some other data points, the building could have been in pretty rough shape causing the price to be much lower than our model would predict it to be.
